# Technical Design: Review Helper

## Implementation Status: Complete

The implementation of the Review Helper application is now complete according to the design specifications outlined in this document. The application includes:

- A comprehensive web interface using Streamlit for all core functionality
- Support for loading cppcheck issues from CSV files
- LLM integration for issue classification
- User interfaces for reviewing and providing feedback on classifications
- Statistical analysis of LLM performance
- Configuration files for LLM models and prompt templates

The application can be started by running:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for the **Review Helper** application. The purpose of this application is to assist developers in processing and classifying issues identified by the cppcheck static analysis tool for C++ projects, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated classification.

The primary goals are to:
- Load cppcheck issues from a CSV file.
- Read source code and build relevant context for LLM analysis.
- Utilize LLMs to classify issues as `false positive`, `need fixing`, or `very serious`.
- Provide an interface for users to review LLM classifications and provide feedback.
- Support multiple LLM providers and context-building strategies.

## 2. System Architecture

The application will be a web-based tool with the following architecture:

-   **Frontend**: Streamlit will be used for building the user interface.
-   **Backend**: Streamlit will also serve as the backend framework. Python will be used for all backend logic, including LLM interactions (via the OpenAI SDK and potentially others) and database operations.
-   **Database**: SQLite will be used for data persistence, storing cppcheck issues, LLM classifications, and user reviews.

### Tech Stack
-   **Web Framework**: Streamlit
-   **LLM Interaction**: OpenAI Python SDK (initially), designed for extension.
-   **Database ORM/Driver**: Python's built-in `sqlite3` module.
-   **Programming Language**: Python

            -   Extracts a code snippet around the `line_number` based on the chosen `strategy`.
            -   Possible strategies:
                -   `fixed_lines`: N lines before and after the issue line.
                -   `function_scope`: Intelligently extracts the entire function containing the issue by analyzing code structure.
                -   `file_scope`: Extracts the entire file content with the issue line highlighted, with a configurable maximum line limit.

            -   `get_token_counts(text: str, model: str) -> Dict[str, int]`: Estimates token counts for a given text and model
    -   **Configuration Format** (`models.yaml`):
        ```yaml
        gpt4:
          provider: openai
          model: gpt-4
          api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY  # API key stored in environment variable

### 4.4. Utilities (`utils/file_utils.py`)

-   **`is_path_safe(file_path: str, project_root: str) -> bool`**:
    -   Validates if the `file_path` (obtained from cppcheck output) is a sub-path of the configured `project_root`.
    -   Normalizes paths to prevent directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../../`).
    -   Returns `True` if safe, `False` otherwise.
-   **`read_file_lines(file_path: str, start_line: int, end_line: int) -> str`**:
    -   Reads specific lines from a file. Used by `context_builder.py`. Ensures `file_path` is safe before reading.

*An SQLite trigger can be used to automatically update `updated_at` in the `issues` table.*

## 6. Workflow

1.  **Configuration**:
    *   Admin/User sets `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` in `config.py` or via an environment variable. This is the root directory of the C++ project to be analyzed.
    *   LLM configurations are defined in `models.yaml`. API keys referenced in `models.yaml` are set as environment variables.
    *   Prompt templates are placed in the `prompts/` directory.
    *   Default LLM and prompt template can be set in `config.py`.

2.  **Load Issues (`pages/01_Load_Issues.py`)**:
    *   User uploads a cppcheck CSV output file.
    *   `issue_parser.py` parses the CSV into a list of issue dictionaries.
    *   For each issue, `data_manager.py` saves it to the `issues` table in SQLite with an initial `status` of `pending_llm`. The `cppcheck_file` path is stored as is.

3.  **LLM Processing (`pages/02_Run_LLM.py`)**:
    *   User navigates to the "Run LLM" page.
    *   The page lists available LLM configurations (from `models.yaml` via `llm_service.py`) and prompt templates (from `prompts/` via `llm_service.py`).
    *   User selects the desired LLM configuration, prompt template, and context building strategy.
    *   User can filter issues to be processed (e.g., those with `status = 'pending_llm'`).
    *   User clicks "Start Processing".
    *   For each selected issue:
        *   The absolute path to the source file is constructed: `os.path.join(config.PROJECT_ROOT_DIR, issue.cppcheck_file)`.
        *   `utils.file_utils.is_path_safe()` validates this path against `config.PROJECT_ROOT_DIR`. **If unsafe, the issue is flagged, and LLM processing is skipped for it.**
        *   If safe, `context_builder.py` reads the source file and extracts the `source_code_context` based on the selected strategy.
        *   `llm_service.py` loads the selected prompt template content.
        *   `llm_service.py` formats the full prompt by combining the template with issue details and source code context.
        *   `llm_service.py` uses the selected `llm_config` and formatted prompt to call the LLM API, recording the start and end time.
        *   The LLM's `classification` and `explanation` are extracted from the response.
        *   Token usage information (prompt tokens, completion tokens, total tokens) is obtained from the LLM API response or estimated using a tokenizer.
        *   `data_manager.py` adds a new record to the `llm_classifications` table with the classification details.
        *   `data_manager.py` also adds a detailed record to the `llm_responses` table, including the full prompt, raw response, token counts, response time, and model parameters.
        *   If this is the first classification for the issue, its `status` is updated to `pending_review`.
    *   The page displays progress (e.g., number of issues processed/remaining, errors).
    *   User has an option to "Stop Processing". This will require the backend processing loop to check a flag (e.g., in Streamlit session state or a temporary marker) between issues and halt if the flag is set.

4.  **Review Issues (`pages/03_Review_Issues.py`)**:
    *   The user navigates to the review page.
    *   `data_manager.py` fetches issues, typically those with `status = 'pending_review'` or all issues with filters.
    *   For each issue, the UI displays:
        *   Issue details from cppcheck
        *   All LLM classification attempts from the `llm_classifications` table
        *   The current `true_classification` if set
    *   The user can:
        *   Review each LLM classification attempt and mark if they agree with it (`user_agrees`)
        *   Add comments to individual LLM attempts (`user_comment`)
        *   Set the final `true_classification` for the issue and add a `true_classification_comment`
    *   `data_manager.py` saves this feedback to the database and updates the issue's `status` to `reviewed` when a `true_classification` is set.

5.  **Statistics (`pages/04_Statistics.py`)**:
    *   The user navigates to the statistics page.
    *   The page provides various metrics and visualizations:
        *   Overall accuracy of each LLM model
        *   Performance comparison of different context building strategies
        *   Success rate of different prompt templates
        *   Distribution of classifications (false positives vs. need fixing vs. very serious)
        *   Time-based analysis of LLM performance
        *   Token usage statistics and response times
    *   Users can filter statistics by:
        *   Date range
        *   Issue severity
        *   Specific LLM models
        *   Context strategies
        *   Prompt templates
    *   The page allows exporting statistics in various formats (CSV, JSON) for further analysis.

6.  **LLM Response Details (`pages/05_LLM_Responses.py`)**:
    *   The user navigates to the LLM responses page.
    *   The page displays detailed records of LLM interactions:
        *   Full prompts sent to the LLM
        *   Raw responses received from the LLM
        *   Token usage statistics (prompt tokens, completion tokens, total tokens)
        *   Response times
        *   Model parameters used
    *   Users can filter responses by:
        *   LLM model
        *   Date range
        *   Issue ID or classification ID
        *   Token usage thresholds
    *   The page provides insights into LLM behavior, helping users optimize prompts and model selection.
    *   Responses can be exported for further analysis or debugging.

## 7. Extensibility

-   **Multiple LLMs**:
    -   `llm_service.py` will load configurations from `models.yaml`, allowing easy addition of new LLM providers or models by updating this YAML file (and ensuring corresponding API key environment variables are set).
    -   The core `classify_issue` function in `llm_service.py` will be designed to work with different provider details specified in the configuration.
    -   The choice of LLM is made by the user on the `02_Run_LLM.py` page.
-   **Context Building Strategies**:
    -   `context_builder.py` will allow for different strategies to be implemented and selected.
    -   New strategies (e.g., AST-based context extraction) can be added as new functions or classes.
    -   The choice of strategy can be made configurable.
    -   Currently supported strategies:
        - `fixed_lines`: Extracts a fixed number of lines before and after the issue line.
        - `function_scope`: Extracts the entire function containing the issue.
        - `file_scope`: Extracts the entire file content with the issue line highlighted, with a safety limit on maximum lines.
-   **Prompt Templating**: (NEW)
    -   Users can create and manage multiple prompt templates in `.txt` files within the `prompts/` directory.
    -   The `02_Run_LLM.py` page allows users to select which prompt template to use for a processing run, enabling experimentation with different prompting techniques.

## 8. Security Considerations

-   **File Path Validation**:
    -   This is paramount. All file paths derived from cppcheck output (`cppcheck_file`) **must** be rigorously validated by `utils.file_utils.is_path_safe()` to ensure they resolve to a location within the configured `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` before any file system access (read operations by `context_builder.py`). This prevents directory traversal attacks.
    -   The application should clearly log or mark issues where file paths are outside the allowed project root.
-   **API Key Management**:
    -   API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) must not be hardcoded in the source code or in `models.yaml` directly if they are sensitive.
    -   `models.yaml` should specify the *name of the environment variable* that holds the API key. These environment variables should be loaded (e.g., using `python-dotenv` from a `.env` file which is gitignored) or set in the deployment environment.
    -   `.env.example` should be provided to guide users on setting up these environment variables.
-   **Input Sanitization**:
    -   While Streamlit handles much of the HTML escaping, be cautious with any data that might be rendered directly or used in constructing file paths or database queries if not already handled by parameterized queries.
    -   The cppcheck `Summary` field, as it can contain commas, should be handled carefully during parsing but is generally safe for display.
-   **Database Security**:
    -   Use parameterized queries for all database interactions (standard practice with `sqlite3` placeholders) to prevent SQL injection.
    -   Input validation is performed before database operations (e.g., checking required fields, validating classification values).
    -   The `data_manager.py` implementation uses a context manager pattern for database connections to ensure proper resource cleanup.
    -   Comprehensive error handling with specific error messages in logs but generic responses to users.
    -   Database directory is created with proper permissions if it doesn't exist.
-   **Error Handling**:
    -   Gracefully handle errors such as missing files, incorrect LLM API responses, or database connection issues. Do not expose sensitive error details to the frontend.

## 9. Deployment Considerations (Brief)

-   The application can be run locally using `streamlit run app.py`.
-   For wider access, it can be deployed using Streamlit Sharing, Docker, or other common Python web app deployment methods.
-   Ensure `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` and API keys are configured correctly in the deployment environment.

## 10. Future Enhancements (Optional)

-   **Batch Processing**: Option to trigger LLM classification for all pending issues in a batch.
-   **Advanced Context Building**: Implement context strategies based on Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing for more precise code snippets.
-   **Direct Cppcheck Integration**: Explore running cppcheck from within the tool or monitoring its output directory.
-   **User Authentication**: If multiple users need to access the tool with distinct roles or data.
-   **Reporting & Analytics**: Dashboards to show LLM accuracy, types of issues found, review progress, etc.
-   **Configuration UI**: Allow setting `PROJECT_ROOT_DIR` and LLM settings through the UI instead of just config files/env vars, especially for initial setup.
-   **Advanced Token Usage Analytics**: Implement cost estimation, usage tracking by team/project, and optimization recommendations based on token usage patterns.
-   **Prompt Optimization**: Automated tools to analyze which prompts are most effective and suggest improvements based on token usage and accuracy metrics.
-   **Model Parameter Tuning**: Interactive tools to experiment with different model parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.) and analyze their impact on classification accuracy and token usage.
